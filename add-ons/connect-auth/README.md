# Installation and Use
The Zendesk Connect authorization is a small utility for the [Amazon Connect app for Zendesk](https://www.zendesk.com/apps/support/amazon-connect/?q=mkp_amazon) that enables accessing the Amazon Connect API from within the app and thus controlling some aspects of Connect's functionality, such as pause and resume call recordings.

You can view the detailed installation steps [here](https://github.com/voicefoundryap/amazon-connect-for-zendesk/blob/master/add-ons/connect-auth/Enabling%20pause%20and%20resume%20call%20recordings-v2.2.pdf).
